Q1:

Ints are essentially shorts but they hold smaller values and take less space
because they do that.

Floats and doubles are basically the same too but floats have less accuracy.

Q2:

I get 3.0000000e+00 as an answer. My guess is that the 2s and 5s are integers
and therefore are truncated after operationa and the truncated value is then
being thrown into a float container.

Q3:

I got: 

i is 	1 
j is 	1 
x is 	0 
y is 	1 

This happened because i++ and ++i is equivilant to i=i+1 in the end so i and 
j are equal to 1. X is equal to 0 because having the ++ after the variable 
adds 1 after the value is used while having it before adds 1 before the value
is used
